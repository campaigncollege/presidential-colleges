8,9,4,1,"Harrison entered Hampden-Sydney in 1787 at the age of 14.  In 1790, his education was cut short when is Episcopalian father removed him from the institution, possibly because of a disagreement with a religious revival occuring at the school."

20,27,13,1,"While he was the first president to attend Yale, William Howard was not the first Taft to walk the pathways of that institution.  The college had become a family tradition by the time Taft enrolled.

Decades later, he wrote:  ""I shall never forget the faces of the boys and the girls in that little Welhausen Mexican School, and I remember even yet the pain of realizing and knowing then that college was closed to practically every one of those children because they were too poor. And I think it was then that I made up my mind that this nation could never rest while the door to knowledge remained closed to any American."""
31,37,15,1,"Nixon was offered a tuition grant to attend Harvard, but he chose to remain in CA and attend the local Whittier College in order to cover the family business while his father recovered from illness.  Nixon played basketball and was an enthusiastic substitute on the football team.  Snubbed by a blue-blood literary society, Nixon co-founded an alternative organization.  Despite the demands of working at the family business, Nixon exhibited an admirable work ethic at school, paving the way for a scholarship to Duke Law School."
32,38,34,1,"A star football player, much of Ford's college lore is dominated by his heroics on the field.

He also notably took a stand to defend a black player on the team when the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets refused to play in an integrated game.

As school president, Reagan led a student revolt when the Eureka administration threatened faculty cut-backs."
35,41,13,1,"The Bush-Yale legacy spans several generations -- going back to HW's father, Prescott Bush.

After valiant service to his country, Bush enrolled in an accelerated program that allowed him to graduate in 2 and 1/2 years.  Despite his relatively short time there, Bush excelled in many areas -- becoming captain of the baseball team, Phi Beta Kappa economics major, and -- like his father before him (and President Taft) -- member of the Skull and Bones society."

41,28,21,2,"Wilson's father was a Presbyterian theologian and served in various posts as clergyman and teacher in the Southeast.  Davidson's ties to the Presbyterian church made it an appealing a place to send young Woodrow.  President Wilson didn't quite finish out his freshman year at Davidson, due to illness.  By the time he recovered, Wilson's father had received a teaching position at Princeton, and so Wilson enrolled there."
